## Tailwind Project

I wanted to learn Tailwind so I created this project for that purpose
Here is a link to the live project: https://rest-countries-with-tailwind.web.app/

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
